  **Directive to Physicians and Family or Surrogates**
subquestion: |
  #### Let's gather information about your wishes for treatment in the event you become incapacitated and are then unable to state your wishes. 

  The **Directive to Physicians and Family or Surrogates** provides three choices for when you are diagnosed with either a **terminal condition** or an **irreversible condition**.
  
  A **terminal condition** is a condition from which you are expected to die within six months, even with available life-sustaining treatment provided in accordance with prevailing standards of medical care.
  
  An **irreversible condition** is a condition (other than terminal) in which you cannot care for yourself or make decisions for yourself and are expected to die (but not necessarily within six months) without life-sustaining treatment provided in accordance with prevailing standards of care.
