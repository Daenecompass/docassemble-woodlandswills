question: |
  **Declaration of Guardian Before Need Arises**
subquestion: |
  Let's gather information about individuals you want to serve as {guardian} in the event you are {incapacitated}.

  In this Declaration, you are stating your wishes in advance as to who you would want the court to appoint in the event the drastic measure of {guardianship} is needed.
terms:
  guardian: |
    This is someone appointed by the court in the event the drastic measure of guardianship is necessary.

    Ultimately, the court will decide who will serve as guardian, but this Declaration will be taken into account.
  guardianship: |
    Guardianship is a court process that might be needed in cases of severe or prolonged incapacity.

    You are also signing a Statutory Durable Power of Attorney, so it is unlikely guardianship would be needed. This is because your agent under a durable power of attorney typically is able to carry out your wishes when you are incapacitated.
  incapacitated: |
    This is a state when you are unable to conduct your own affairs.

    In other words, you are unable make normal, rational decisions that are not harmful to yourself or to others.
