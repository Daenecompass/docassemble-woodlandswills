  **Directive to Physicians and Family or Surrogates**
subquestion: |
  Let's gather information about your wishes for treatment in the event you become {incapacitated}.

  The {Directive to Physicians and Family or Surrogates} provides three choices for when you are diagnosed with either a {terminal condition} or an {irreversible condition}.
terms:
  incapacitated: |
    This is a state when you are unable to communicate your own desires concerning treatment (for instance, if you are in a coma).
  terminal condition: |
    A terminal condition is a condition from which you are expected to die within six months, even with available life-sustaining treatment provided in accordance with prevailing standards of medical care.
  irreversible condition: |
    An irreversible condition is a condition (other than terminal) in which you cannot care for yourself or make decisions for yourself and are expected to die (but not necessarily within six months) without life-sustaining treatment provided in accordance with prevailing standards of care.
  Directive to Physicians and Family or Surrogates: |
    Sometimes referred to as a living will or advanced directive, this documents your preferences for end-of-life treatment.
